Function creation:
	1) Create new Function app in AAD with PowerShell Core runtime stack, OS Windows, 
	2) Add PnP.PowerShell PowerShell Module
		As we want to use PowerShell to connect to Sharepoint Online, we need to add the PnP.PowerShell module to our app. This is done by modifying the requirements.psd1 file
		@{
		    'PnP.PowerShell' = '2.*'
		}
		In the profile.psd1 file disable Authenticate with Azure PowerShell using MSI section as we do not need it
		#if ($env:MSI_SECRET) {
		#    Disable-AzContextAutosave -Scope Process | Out-Null
		#    Connect-AzAccount -Identity
		#}
	3) In Authentication blade, add Microsoft as identity provider in Azure function (note name of AAD application, you will need it later)
	4) Enable system managed identity in Azure function
	5) Create following function variables:
			a. SPO_SENSITIVITY_LABEL – set value to GUID of sensitivity label, that will be applied to SPO site, if no label is specified via function parameter.
			b. SPO_TENANT_NAME – set value to short tenant name. e.g. deverstegroup
	6) Create new function with HTTP trigger template. Use name NewSite. As authorization select Anonymous (auth. will be handled via AAD integration). Replace function code with code from attachment.
	7) Grand Directory.ReadWrite.All & Sites.FullControl.All permissions to managed identity. You can follow this link: https://nanddeepnachanblogs.com/posts/2023-10-17-mi-pnp-powershell-sp-acs/ - skip directly to chapter Assign permissions to the managed identity
 
Configure AAD authorization:
	1) Open AAD -> App registrations and find the application you created in step 3 above.
	2) Select App roles.
	3) Click on Create new role and create role with following settings:
		
		
	4) Open AAD -> Enterprise applications and find the same application.
	5) Select Properties and switch Assignment required to Yes. (this steps is very important!)
	6) Visible to users set to No
	7) Click on Users and groups and add some test user and assign him the role DLG.SPO.ADMIN.AT
		
		
 
Test basic function invocation:
	1) As user you added in step 7 above, open browser and paste this URL: https://dlgautomationspo.azurewebsites.net/api/NewSite?Type=CommunicationSite&Title=estSite&Name=ATtestsite1&Owner=admin.furda@deverstegroup.onmicrosoft.com
		Note: replace function URL & owner UPN with your values
	2) After authorization, the site should be created.

Next steps:
            We need your final decision how you will be calling newsite function – for service principal or system managed identity additional authorization configuration is needed.
